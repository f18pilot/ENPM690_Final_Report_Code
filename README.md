# ENPM690_Final_Report_Code
ENPM690 code for robot integration
This code is for the Pirate model robot with a raspberry Pi4.  The playing field is a 10 x 10 grid 
with obstacles at 4,5 and 8,3 and a start position at 9,9.  The desired object is a t 0,7, and the 
robot task is to pick it up and deliver it to 0,0.  This code finds the path from the starting
position to the object and then from the object to the Goal.  

This program is written on python 3.7 and raspian Buster.
